The employees were friendly and helpful, they looked like they enjoyed their jobs, and I would make this a regular place.\",\n          \"I chose the 4 Queens for my visit to Las Vegas for several reasons, and I'll admit a good lot of those involved the low price of the room. (Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard, the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor.)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the quality of my room was far below what I expected, or even dreamed was possible.\\\\n\\\\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms; generally I only want them to be clean (not spotless, clean) and relatively safe. Non-smoking is also on the list.\\\\n\\\\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.\\\\n\\\\nThere was hair (of the nether-region variety) in the bathtub. In fact, I don't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay. I don't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself, and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\\\\n\\\\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy. I'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance (humor me) to make myself feel better.\\\\n\\\\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived, and spotted quite easily. This was touted to be a non-smoking room. I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff. \\\\n\\\\nNope; no such luck.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, there were cigarette burns in the bedding (which was made of some, scratchy, ugly cheap fabric). Two of the three lamps in the room did not work. At all. The remote did not work. The air conditioner was very, very loud.\\\\n\\\\nI didn't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we're being held in the city the weekend I stayed, and on the 15th floor, I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly. Granted, I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay, but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\\\\nOh, and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay. I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\\\\n\\\\nLuckily, I take Ambien to sleep, and am dead to the world at night. Even with the Ambien, the world's rattliest, loudest air conditioner, still woke me up several times each night. This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having. Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\\\\n\\\\nUpdate! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining. Guess what? It got worse! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow (defying the laws of sound) louder, and played later into the evening. Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am, they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them. This went on until about 8 am. I pounded on the wall twice, called the front desk, and nothing was done! I didn't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\\\\n\\\\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am, five hours early for my flight, because the hotel was just that damn bad, and I couldn't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\\\\n\\\\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breaking-out.\",\n          \"I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \\\\n\\\\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \\\\n\\\\nThought it

my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them This went on until about 8 am I pounded on the wall twice called the front desk and nothing was done I didnt sleep a wink despite the AmbiennnI finally headed to the airport around 9 am five hours early for my flight because the hotel was just that damn bad and I couldnt stand the filthiness and sleaze any longernnAbsolutely the worst hotel Ive ever stayed in The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breakingout\",\n          \"I went here on the day of a wedding Im from out of town for a last minute pedicure I didnt really know where else to go so I just stopped here on a whim it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails nnThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC and wonderful to chat with Its two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new and before you ask I actually used the exact same brandcolor nail polish as my prior crap pedicure They dont have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long  nnThought it was worth a review\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
